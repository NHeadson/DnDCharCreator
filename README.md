# D&D Character Manager

This is a Vue.js application built with Vuetify for managing D&D 5e characters. It features Firebase integration for data storage and a comprehensive access control system to protect against unauthorized usage.

## 🔐 Security Features

This application includes a two-tier security system:

1. **Access Control**: Prevents random internet users from creating characters and overwhelming your Firebase storage
2. **Admin Authentication**: Provides additional permissions for editing and deleting existing characters

## ⚙️ Configuration

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure the following variables:

### Firebase Configuration
```bash
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_firebase_api_key_here
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_firebase_auth_domain_here
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=your_firebase_project_id_here
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_firebase_storage_bucket_here
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id_here
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_firebase_app_id_here
```

### Security Configuration
```bash
# Admin password for edit/delete operations (DM access)
VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=your_secure_admin_password_here

# Group access password for character creation 
VITE_ACCESS_PASSWORD=your_group_access_password_here
```

## 🎮 How It Works

- **Public Access**: Anyone can view existing characters
- **Group Access**: Users must enter the group password to create new characters (2-hour sessions)
- **Admin Access**: DMs can use the admin password to edit/delete characters (30-minute sessions)

This system protects your Firebase storage from spam while allowing your D&D group easy access to character management.

## 💿 Install

Set up your project using your preferred package manager. Use the corresponding command to install the dependencies:

| Package Manager                                                | Command        |
|---------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|
| [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started)                   | `yarn install` |
| [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v7/commands/npm-install)     | `npm install`  |
| [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation)                          | `pnpm install` |
| [bun](https://bun.sh/#getting-started)                        | `bun install`  |

After completing the installation, your environment is ready for Vuetify development.

## 🔐 Environment Configuration

**IMPORTANT**: This application requires environment variables to be set for security.

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and set your passwords:

   ```bash
   # Required for admin authentication (edit/delete characters)
   VITE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=YourSecureAdminPassword123!
   
   # Required for access control (create characters)
   VITE_ACCESS_PASSWORD=YourGroupAccessCode456!
   ```

**Security Note**: Never commit your `.env` file to version control. The passwords should only exist in your local environment and deployment environment.

## 💡 Usage

This section covers how to start the development server and build your project for production.

### Starting the Development Server

To start the development server with hot-reload, run the following command. The server will be accessible at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
yarn dev
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

> Add NODE_OPTIONS='--no-warnings' to suppress the JSON import warnings that happen as part of the Vuetify import mapping. If you are on Node [v21.3.0](https://nodejs.org/en/blog/release/v21.3.0) or higher, you can change this to NODE_OPTIONS='--disable-warning=5401'. If you don't mind the warning, you can remove this from your package.json dev script.

### Building for Production

To build your project for production, use:

```bash
yarn build
```

(Repeat for npm, pnpm, and bun with respective commands.)

Once the build process is completed, your application will be ready for deployment in a production environment.
